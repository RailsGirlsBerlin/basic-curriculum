Basically, it’s an app about this workshop with a map to see where everyone comes from. It’s also a sort of guest book where attendees can put comments. It’s a very basic one, so you can easily adapt it for other ideas you may have.

If you want to know how the App will look like after you finished the tutorial you can find an example [HERE](http://bit.ly/RGBeurucamp)

Have fun coding and don't forget to ask your coaches when something is unclear ;-)
